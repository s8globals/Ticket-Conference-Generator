### **Project Description: Image Upload Form with Ticket Generation, Cloudinary Integration, and Ticket Management**

**Objective**:  
This project involves creating a multi-step form where users can input their personal details, upload an image, and submit the data. Once submitted, a **ticket** is generated for each user submission. The user can view all generated tickets, track progress, and interact with their submissions. The image is uploaded to Cloudinary, and robust form validation ensures that all fields are filled out correctly before submission.

### **Core Features**:

1. **Multi-Step Form**:
   - **Step 1**: Users enter their personal details (name, email).
   - **Step 2**: Users upload an image, which is validated and uploaded to Cloudinary.
   - **Validation**: Each field, including the name, email, and image, undergoes validation before moving to the next step.

2. **Ticket Generation**:
   - Once the user completes the form and submits it, a **unique ticket** is generated for the submission.
   - The ticket contains information like **user details**, **image URL**, **status**, and **submission time**.
   - The ticket is stored in the backend for future retrieval and management.

3. **Ticket Management Page**:
   - A dedicated **ticket viewing page** is created where users can see all tickets they have generated, including their ticket details.
   - The page should display a list of tickets with relevant details like **Ticket ID**, **Submission Date**, **Status**, and **User Information**.
   - Each ticket will be clickable to view more detailed information or edit the submission if needed.

4. **Cloudinary Integration**:
   - After the image is uploaded, it's stored in Cloudinary's cloud storage, and the secure **Cloudinary URL** is saved.
   - The image is available for preview on the ticket generation page and throughout the ticket management interface.
   
5. **Error Handling with Pop-up Dialogs**:
   - **Form Validation**: If any field is left incomplete or contains incorrect data (e.g., invalid email), an **animated pop-up dialog** appears with the respective error message (e.g., "Invalid email format", "Please upload an image").
   - The pop-up will include a warning icon and a brief, clear error message.
   - **Animation**: The error message modal will slide in and out smoothly for better UX, using simple CSS animations.

6. **Navigation**:
   - Users can move between **form steps** (Step 1 and Step 2) with navigation buttons (`Back` and `Next`).
   - After submitting the form, users will be redirected to the **Ticket Management Page**.
   - Users can click on any ticket to view detailed information, including the uploaded image.

7. **Ticket Viewing and Editing**:
   - **Ticket Detail Page**: Each ticket has a page displaying detailed information (name, email, image preview, etc.).
   - Users can choose to **edit** or **re-submit** the form by going back to Step 1 or Step 2 to make changes and resubmit.
   
8. **User-Friendly UI**:
   - **Responsive Design**: The form and ticket pages are fully responsive, ensuring smooth access on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
   - **Animations**: Smooth transitions, button animations, and modal animations to enhance the visual experience when submitting the form and displaying errors.
   - **Consistent Design**: Clean, modern UI components like rounded buttons, clear typography, and a simple layout to ensure ease of use.

9. **Ticket Status**:
   - After submission, each ticket will have a **status** (e.g., Pending, Submitted, In Progress).
   - The ticket status will be displayed on the ticket management page and can be updated in the backend.
   
10. **User Authentication**:
    - To manage multiple users and tickets, user authentication (via login/signup) is added to the platform.
    - Each user can only see and manage their own tickets. 
    - Passwords are securely handled using hashing and salting methods (bcrypt).

   - Validation ensures that the email is in the correct format.
   
2. **Step 2**:
   - User uploads an image.
   - The image is validated and uploaded to Cloudinary.
   
3. **Error Handling**:
   - If any field is invalid, an animated pop-up appears to inform the user of the specific issue (e.g., "Invalid email format", "Image required").

   - The user is redirected to the **Ticket Management Page** to view all tickets.

- **Ticket Management Page**:
   - The user can view all generated tickets with details like **Ticket ID**, **Name**, **Email**, **Status**, and the **Image URL**.
   - Users can click a ticket to view its details and make any necessary edits or updates.
